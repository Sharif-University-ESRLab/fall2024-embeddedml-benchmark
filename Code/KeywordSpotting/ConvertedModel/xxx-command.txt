xxd -i speech_commands_model_float32.tflite model_data.h

This command uses the utility xxd to convert the binary file speech_commands_model_float32.tflite into a C header file named model_data.h.
The -i option tells xxd to output in C include file style, which creates a C array containing the binary data from the model along with a variable that holds its length.
This allows us to embed the model directly into the source code without needing to load it from external storage at runtime. Needed for running ML code on STM32!
